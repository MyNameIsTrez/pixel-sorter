# PyOpenCL Color Sorter

Sorts the pixels of an image based on their color.

Before vs after:
<p>
	<img src="media/palette_input.png" alt="This input palette isn't very sorted by color.">
	<img src="media/palette_output.png" alt="This output palette is pretty much optimally sorted by color.">
</p>

Put a different way, it blurs an image, while retaining all of the original pixels:

<p><img src="media/blurry_elephant.png" alt="Half is the input toy elephant and the other half is the blurry output toy elephant."></p>

It does this by repeatedly attempting to swap two random pixels, only doing the swap if that'd place them next to pixels with more similar colors.

At the heart of the program lies my port of [CUDA-Shuffle](https://github.com/djns99/CUDA-Shuffle)'s `PhiloxBijectiveFunction` shuffling class.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into it.
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python sort.py -h` for the usage of the program

## How to turn the output images into a video

### webm
`ffmpeg -framerate 1 -i output/elephant_%04d.png -crf 0 -s 1024x662 -sws_flags neighbor -r 30 output/output.webm`

### mp4 (bigger files but more widely supported)
`ffmpeg -framerate 1 -i output/elephant_%04d.png -crf 0 -s 1024x662 -sws_flags neighbor -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 30 output/output.mp4`
